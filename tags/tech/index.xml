It is a lot easier than reading pages of forums to get the main ideas of the discussions since the top comments and active discussions bubble to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to run a site for discussing and sharing information that are useful for people working in techparks and the format that immediately clicked in my mind was the hacknews style. I began writing my own &lt;a href="https://github.com/techparknews/hsnews"&gt;clone&lt;/a&gt; based on the work of people from &lt;a href="http://hackerschool.com/"&gt;hackerschool&lt;/a&gt; but it lacked the polish and look to make the people trust and even sign up, I had send invites to few of my friends to try but the turnaround rate was quite low.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
